Overview of the Code
This code analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 data for Kenya, the United States, and India. Its goal is to provide insights into key metrics such as total cases, death rates, vaccination progress, and to create a choropleth map showing cases by country.

Key Components
Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations like line graphs.
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations, especially the choropleth map.
Loading Data:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named owid-covid-data.csv, which contains the COVID-19 statistics.
Data Cleaning:

The clean_covid_data function converts the date column to a datetime format and filters the data for the specified countries.
Visualization Functions:

plot_cases_over_time: Plots total COVID-19 cases over time for the selected countries.
plot_death_rate_over_time: Calculates and visualizes the death rate over time.
plot_vaccination_progress: Shows the total number of vaccinations administered over time.
plot_choropleth_map: Creates an interactive map displaying total COVID-19 cases by country for the latest available date.
Main Execution:

A list of countries is defined, the data is cleaned, and the various plotting functions are called to generate visualizations.
Objectives
Insights: The code aims to reveal trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations in the chosen countries.
Visual Representation: By generating graphs and a map, it helps users quickly understand important data trends.
Summary
This code is a comprehensive tool that leverages Python libraries to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data, making complex health information accessible and easy to understand.
